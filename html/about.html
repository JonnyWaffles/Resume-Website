<h2>
Who am I?
</h2>
<p>
I'm Jonny Fuller. I grew up in Richmond, VA, graduated in 2010 from Virginia Commonwealth University with a BA in Homeland Security and Criminal Justice. I am infinitely thankful to call Church Hill my home.
Seeking a post college career I stumbled in to an entry level position at the excess and surplus lines career Markel Corporation beginning my career in the commercial insurance industry. I now work as a Fidelity
and Crime underwriter for Great American Insurance Group. Occasionally, I even write <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/titanfall-config-guide-the-best-settings-to-maximize-your-effectiveness/">words</a> for money.
I wrote the most successful Counter-Strike <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121447468">guide</a> on Steam.
</p>
<p>
I love learning and never seek to idle or stagnate. Currently, I am striving to learn information technology and development. Recently, I discovered a deep love for data science and analytics and further seek to improve
my understanding of mathematics. 
</p>
<p>
After a decade of unsuccessful semi-competitive Counter-Strike, I now spend my evenings playing Dota2 with my wife, friends, and family. My passion for competitive gaming and esports never wanes even as I age.
You'll find me rooting for the two premiere North American esports franchises, Complexity and Evil Geniuses. I'm deeply passionate about politics, technology, spaceships, video games, esports, urban development, inequality,
feminism, thus planning my life is neigh impossible.
